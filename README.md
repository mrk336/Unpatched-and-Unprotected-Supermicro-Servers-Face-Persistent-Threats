# Unpatched and Unprotected: Supermicro Servers Face Persistent Threats

Supermicro servers are trusted workhorses in data centers around the world. They support everything from cloud infrastructure to AI workloads. But recent discoveries reveal that some of these systems are vulnerable to firmware-level attacks that can persist undetected even after reboots or OS reinstalls.

## What’s the Issue?

Security researchers at Binarly uncovered two critical vulnerabilities in Supermicro’s Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware:

**CVE-2025-7937**  
This flaw allows attackers to craft a rogue firmware map table in an unsigned region. The BMC mistakenly validates this malicious table, enabling unauthorized firmware installation.

**CVE-2025-6198**  
This vulnerability lets attackers modify the signing table while preserving valid cryptographic digests. As a result, the BMC accepts malicious firmware as legitimate, bypassing signature verification.

These weaknesses stem from poor cryptographic enforcement and open the door to stealthy, persistent malware that can survive across system lifecycles.

## Why It Matters

Firmware attacks are especially dangerous because they operate below the operating system. They’re invisible to antivirus tools, difficult to detect, and can grant attackers deep control over hardware. Once embedded, these threats can persist indefinitely — making them ideal for espionage, sabotage, or long-term compromise.

## A Familiar Pattern: Dell’s ReVault Vulnerabilities

These Supermicro flaws echo the recent ReVault attack disclosed by Cisco Talos, which targeted Dell’s ControlVault3 firmware. Over 100 Dell laptop models were affected.

Among the Dell CVEs:

**CVE-2025-24311**  
An out-of-bounds read in the `cv_send_blockdata` function allowed attackers to leak sensitive information from Dell ControlVault3 firmware prior to version 5.15.10.14.

**CVE-2025-25050 and CVE-2025-24922**  
These enabled buffer overflows and privilege escalation via biometric and sensor firmware components.

Both Supermicro and Dell vulnerabilities show how attackers can exploit firmware-level flaws to bypass traditional security controls and gain persistent access.

## What You Can Do

If you’re running Supermicro servers or Dell laptops, patching is essential. Firmware updates have been released and should be applied immediately. Beyond that, consider auditing firmware integrity with tools like Binarly’s platform, segmenting management networks, and monitoring for signs of tampering.

### Mitigation Strategies Using Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk

Organizations using Supermicro servers can strengthen their defenses with modern SIEM platforms like Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk. These tools offer powerful ways to detect, investigate, and respond to firmware-level threats.

**Microsoft Sentinel**

Use custom KQL analytics rules to monitor for unusual BMC activity, such as firmware updates or remote access attempts. Integrate threat intelligence feeds to tag known malicious firmware hashes. Upload watchlists of vulnerable assets and automate responses using Logic Apps. Defender for Endpoint can help monitor firmware integrity and alert on suspicious changes.

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteUrl contains "BMC" or RemoteIP in (list_of_BMC_IPs)
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("fwupdate.exe", "ipmitool.exe")
| summarize count() by DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, RemoteIP

```

### Threat Intelligence Integration 

Ingest threat intel feeds from Binarly or CVE databases to tag known malicious firmware hashes or IPs. Use Sentinel’s TI indicators to correlate with logs.

### Watchlist for Vulnerable Assets 

Upload a CSV of Supermicro server IPs or hostnames into Sentinel Watchlists. Use this to filter alerts and prioritize investigations.

### Automation via Playbooks Use Logic Apps to trigger automated responses:

Isolate affected host from network.

Notify security team via Teams or email.

Trigger firmware integrity check script via Azure Runbook.

### Firmware Integrity Monitoring

Deploy Defender for Endpoint or custom agents to monitor firmware hashes. Alert on changes to SPI flash or bootloader regions.


**Splunk**

Configure log collection from IPMI/BMC interfaces using syslog or SNMP traps. Use SPL queries to detect firmware update attempts and signature manipulation. Tag Supermicro servers with risk scores and build dashboards to visualize firmware events. Splunk SOAR can automate quarantine actions, ticket creation, and firmware rollback procedures.

```spl
index=bmc_logs sourcetype="ipmi"
| search "firmware update" OR "fwmap" OR "sig_table"
| stats count by host, user, command

```

These strategies help security teams proactively defend against firmware-level attacks that traditional endpoint tools may miss.

## Final Thoughts

Firmware is often overlooked, but it’s foundational to system trust. These recent disclosures are a wake-up call for IT teams, security professionals, and infrastructure architects. Vigilance at the firmware level is essential because once it’s compromised, everything above it is at risk.
